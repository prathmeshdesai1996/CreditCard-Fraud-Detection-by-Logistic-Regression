# CreditCard Fraud Detection by Logistic Regression

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using logistic regression. The dataset used for this project is from kaggle and the link to the same is provided in ["data.txt"](https://github.com/prathmeshdesai1996/CreditCard-Fraud-Detection-by-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/data.txt). The project also includes a ["requirements.txt"](https://github.com/prathmeshdesai1996/CreditCard-Fraud-Detection-by-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/requirement.txt) file that lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the project
To run the project, open the ["CreditCard Fraud Detection by Logistic Regression.ipynb"](https://github.com/prathmeshdesai1996/CreditCard-Fraud-Detection-by-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/CreditCard%20Fraud%20Detection%20by%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb) notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and follow the instructions in the notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 492 fraud cases out of 284,807 transactions. Therefore, the project uses logistic regression to detect fraud cases.

## Results
The project achieves an accuracy of 99.91% on the test set and an AUC score of 0.974. This demonstrates the effectiveness of logistic regression in detecting credit card fraud.
